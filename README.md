# THIS WILL INTRODUCE A CONFLICT????

1. Walk participants through the existing code + show it running
	* Run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` from within the root directory and go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
	* Try the addition button, change the values and try again to verify it is working.

2. Show participants how to create branches. This is probably a good time to talk about the specific branching strategy being employed at an organizational level. Then, have a participant come to the machine and implement subtraction in a new branch.

3. After finishing the additions, commit and push to the new branch and show thew new branch in Github. After, start a pull request to show participants the value of peer review via pull requests.

4. After vetting the change as a group, another user should accept this change and merge the PR.

5. Can continue to iterate on this idea by adding multiplication, division, factorial (for the really adventurous), even exponents! Really groundbreaking stuff here.

6. TODO: add something like Mocha to automatically test functionality.
